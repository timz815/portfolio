            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <div class="para-section">
              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>
                White Rock City Orchestra (WRCO) is a non-profit, community-focused ensemble of semi-professional and experienced amateur musicians, dedicated to sharing music with the White Rock community.
              </p>
              <h3>Problem Space</h3>
              <p>
                Each season, the orchestra performs three major paid concerts in the spring, summer and winter, which sometimes includes collaborations with guest artists. While the winter Christmas concert attracts large audiences, the spring and summer attendance can fluctuate which can make planning and programming for the rest of the season more challenging.
              </p>
              <h3>Client Goals</h3>
              <p>
                The orchestra wants to reduce this uneven seasonal distribution to ease financial pressure earlier in the year.
              </p>
              <p>
                With limited operational capacity, the solution must be easy to roll out and low-maintenance.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="para-section">
              <h3>Opportunity</h3>
              <p>
                Since people are already planning festive outings, the Christmas concert attracts large audiences during the holidays. This pattern creates an opportunity for WRCO to leverage into engagement across the rest of the season.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="para-section">
              <h3>Research + Insights</h3>
              <p>
                To understand what drives attendance, we ran co-creation workshops with concert-goers alongside creating user personas. Across two sessions with seven participants, we guided activities to uncover motivations, expectations, and barriers. These insights helped reveal patterns in audience behavior that informed strategies for increasing engagement throughout the season.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our key findings were:

                  <h3>Event planning is usually handled by a single organizer</h3>
                  <p>
                    Attendance decisions are often made by a single organizer (e.g., a parent, partner, or gift-giver) on behalf of a group. These buyers prioritize early, reliable information such as concert or ticket sale dates, to coordinate schedules and reduce planning uncertainty. When this information is not communicated ahead of time or varies widely between seasons, some may find alternative activities.
                  </p>

                <div class="insight-card">
                  <h3>Event memorability is shaped by more than just the performance</h3>
                  <p>
                    While the musical performance defines the core experience, pre-show and intermission moments can play an outsized role in how attendees remember the event overall. Optional, lightweight engagements during these moments can make the event more memorable and influence perceived value.

              As well, we mapped a before user journey to capture how ticket buyers currently plan and buy tickets on their website to find where uncertainty, friction, and missed engagement opportunities occur.

              <h3>Design Focus</h3>
              <p>
                Thus, our driving question became:
                How might WRCO maintain momentum across the season by improving communication and staying connected with their audience through smarter use of existing touchpoints?

            <h2>Solution Briefing</h2>
            <div class="para-section">
              <h3>A Revamped Communication Package</h3>
              <p>
                We proposed a lightweight, multi-channel communication system designed to increase audience exposure to upcoming concerts while remaining feasible for a small team to maintain. Rather than relying on a single promotional moment, the solution creates a set of reinforcing touchpoints across the season that support earlier planning, sustained awareness, and stronger audience engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system brings together three primary communication channels: a printed seasonal concert booklet, a website revamp, and email promotions, supported by small enhancements to the in-concert experience. Together, these template-based touchpoints, grounded in WRCO’s design language, form a continuous communication loop that keeps future concerts top of mind, reduces planning friction for attendees, and remains easy for the organization to update and maintain.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="para-section">
              <h3>The Booklet</h3>
              <p>
                The concert booklet plays a supportive role during the live experience by helping maintain engagement during natural downtime such as pre-show and intermission. Beyond program and venue information, it introduces the orchestra’s history and members while intentionally signposting upcoming concerts and relevant offers, which encourages attendees to consider the rest of the season while interest is still high. As a tangible, take-home artifact, the booklet can help support planning after the event, particularly for newer attendees.

              <h3>The Website</h3>
              <p>
                Since the website is the primary place concert-goers check dates, pricing, and ticket options, its structure plays a key role in drop off rates. Prioritizing key  information will reduce cognitive effort and keeps attention on what users are looking for. In addition, streamlining the purchase flow and surfacing key logistical details upfront can help the site better supports planners in moving from intent to action.

              <p>
                The email promotion remains the orchestra’s most direct communication channel, but is reframed from standalone announcements into a structured sequence of teasers and reminders that build momentum throughout the season. Rather than focusing solely on ticket sales, emails highlight program themes, venue access, and transit information to help audiences anticipate the experience and plan ahead. This approach also supports the needs of ticket buyers who are coordinating schedules in advance, while maintaining excitement between concerts.

            <h3>Locking Back...</h3>
            <p>
              This project took place within the realities of a small, community-run organization operating on a highly seasonal schedule. As the semester progressed, WRCO’s focus shifted toward preparing for a major upcoming concert, which reduced opportunities for ongoing collaboration and feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than treating this as a blocker, we adjusted our approach to work within these constraints. We prioritized research methods that required minimal stakeholder involvement while still providing meaningful direction, including design ethnography and co-creation workshops with concert-goers as proxies for actual attendees. This allowed the work to continue moving forward without placing additional demands on the organization, while still grounding decisions in real user insight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Presenting our progress weekly further shaped how I approached the work. The need to clearly communicate evolving research and design decisions to our class reinforced the importance of clarity and narrative discipline. This practice helped strengthen my ability to distill complex ideas into concise, accessible stories; an approach that ensured that design rationale remained understandable, actionable, and grounded.
